Steps to run Backend
Run node server.js
Open HTML file in the browser.
Fill out the form and click "Generate Schedule".
The backend will securely send the request to Simplicity and return the response.


COMMAND   PID   USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
node     12345 user   23u  IPv4  34567      0t0  TCP localhost:8000 (LISTEN)
Note the PID (e.g., 12345).

Kill the process using:
kill -9 12345
(Replace 12345 with the actual PID from the first command)

So essentially, we have to start the Node.js Backend, run the thing locally or not but we can fix that later.
